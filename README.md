# Transfer Function Analysis of Dynamic Systems [![View <File Exchange Title> on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/####)
**Curriculum Module**  
_Created with R2020b. Compatible with R2020b and later releases._  

## Description ##
This curriculum module contains interactive [live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) and a [MATLAB&reg; app](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/app-designer.html) that teach transfer function analysis of dynamic systems. In the first script, students learn to derive transfer functions from ODEs and compute impulse, step, and forced responses. In subsequent scripts, students perform pole-zero and frequency domain analyses. Throughout the module, students apply transfer functions to analyze the dynamics of physical and electrical systems. In the final lesson, students perform a frequency domain analysis of an LC filter in a buck converter. A review of Laplace transforms is also included for students seeking a refresher. These lessons can be used as part of a lecture, as activities in an instructional setting, or as interactive assignments to be completed outside of class.
